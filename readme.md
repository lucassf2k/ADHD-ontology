## Introduction

Ontologies in the Semantic Web
Ontologies are formal structures that describe concepts and their relationships within a specific domain, enabling interoperability between different systems and standardizing the understanding of information. In the context of the Semantic Web, ontologies are essential for giving meaning to data and facilitating the automatic processing of information by machines, helping to connect data that would otherwise remain scattered. The Semantic Web is the evolution of the traditional internet, allowing information to be understood and interpreted intelligently by computers, with the help of languages and standards such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language).

## OntoUML

OntoUML is an extension of the UML (Unified Modeling Language) standard used for conceptual modeling of complex systems based on formal ontological theories. It is specially designed to accurately represent aspects of reality, following principles of Formal Ontology, such as the UFO (Unified Foundational Ontology) theory. OntoUML facilitates the creation of more expressive models, allowing for better capture of nuances and relationships between concepts.

## OWL (Web Ontology Language)

OWL is an XML-based markup language used to define ontologies on the Semantic Web. It allows for the rigorous description of concepts, properties, and their interrelationships within a specific domain, being capable of expressing complex logic and enabling automated inference. OWL facilitates semantic interoperability, allowing different systems to exchange data in a comprehensible way.

## Basic Explanation of ADHD

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological disorder that primarily affects children and adolescents, although it can persist into adulthood. It is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which vary depending on the degree and profile of each individual. People with ADHD often struggle to maintain focus, organize tasks, and control impulses. This disorder can significantly impact academic, professional, and social life, and its diagnosis is based on symptom analysis, patient history, and clinical evaluation.

Perspectives on ADHD: Diagnosis, Symptom, and Evaluation
This work presents three perspectives on ADHD: Diagnosis, Symptom, and Evaluation. Diagnosing ADHD is complex and involves a combination of factors, including observing symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, along with a detailed analysis of the individual’s clinical and behavioral history. The symptoms may manifest differently depending on the person, varying in intensity and affecting different areas of life, such as academic performance and social relationships. Evaluating ADHD is an ongoing process that requires the involvement of specialists and is essential for adapting interventions and treatment strategies to each patient’s specific needs, offering a more personalized and effective approach to managing the disorder.
